# Create your own CMakeLists.txt file here that will build your project, based 
# on the directory structure you choose. You can use the CMakeLists.txt files
# we provided in the src directory of Project 1 and Project 2 as a starting point.

# You will also have to add a CMakelists.txt file in the common/ directory. 

# Running the standard CMake build sequence should result in the following executables:
#   wSender
#   wReceiver
#   wSenderOpt
#   wReceiverOpt
